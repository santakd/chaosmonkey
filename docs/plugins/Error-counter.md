An error counter is used to record the rate of errors generated by Chaos Monkey
to an external system such as a metrics or alerting system.

Inside of Netflix, we use an error counter to record error counts to [Atlas](https://github.com/netflix/atlas/wiki), our metric system<sup>1</sup>.

If you wish to record the error counts with an external system, you need to:

1. Give your error counter a name (e.g., "ganglia")
1. Code up a type in Go that implements the [ErrorCounter](https://godoc.org/github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey/#ErrorCounter) interface
1. Modify [errorcounter.go](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey/blob/master/errorcounter/errorcounter.go) so that it recognizes your error counter.
1. Edit your [config file](Configuration File Format) to specify your error counter.

<sup>1</sup>Unfortunately, we are unable to release this error counter as
open source. Our Atlas error counter communicates with a version of
[Prana](https://github.com/Netflix/Prana) that has not been released as open
source.
